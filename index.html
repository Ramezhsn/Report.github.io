                    <p>➤ The recent escalation in conflict within Palestine has coincided with heightened tensions along Lebanon's southern borders, leading to confrontations within Lebanese territory. This escalation marks a departure from the relatively stable rules of engagement observed since approximately 2012. Observers draw parallels between the current tensions and the 2006 conflict between Lebanon and Israel, noting similarities in intensity and dynamics.</p>
                    <p>Assessing the impact on Lebanon, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of conflict escalation, particularly regarding internal displacement and humanitarian needs. Understanding the evolving situation is essential for effective response planning and assistance delivery.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>➤ The looming threat of an armed confrontation is alarming. Such conflict might see intense air raids and attacks, targeting not only Lebanon's southern regions but also the densely populated southern suburbs of Beirut, the agriculturally crucial northern Beqaa, and border areas. The escalation of the situation cannot be anticipated due to the dynamic and volatile nature of the situation.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>➤ The assumed scenarios revolve around a nationwide scale. The 3 governorates that are at high risk as per historical data review are South Lebanon, Beqaa, and Beirut. The currently registered populace of these governorates is around 1,750,000, 51% Females and 49% Males, and out of the total number of people, 29% are children between the age of 0-18.</p>
